==============================================================================================================
This program is a flexible framework for working with files.
The program will filter the files in a given directory according to various conditions, and order the
filenames that passed the filtering according to various properties.

The Files in the Package:

1.  DirectoryProcessor.java:    The main class of the program, gets the arguments and running the whole manipulation
                                process.

2.  SectionAnalyzer.java:   This class is taking care of all the section analyzing during the program process.
                            It gets a section and checking it, creating manipulators by the section commands and also
                            validating the input is correct.

3. FirstException.java:     This exception thrown when there is a warning in the program. We made this class just to
                            have more readable code and for easy flow.

4. ManipulatorGenerator.java:   This class gets a command line and makes the manipulators requested. it validates the
                                data and using polymorphism makes the correct manipulator.

5. SecondException.java:    This exception thrown when there is an error with the format of the FLT file. we override
                            the get_message() method in order to print the message in the wanted template.

6. manipulators package:    This package includes all the filters and order types. each class in the package represents
                            a type of filter / order and does the wanted action.
